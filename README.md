ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: HR Analytics Dashboard! ðŸ“Š

In this project, I analyzed HR data to uncover key insights related to employee performance, attrition rates, department-wise distribution, and salary trends. Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that provides HR professionals with valuable workforce insights for strategic decision-making.

ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:
ðŸš€ Employee Performance & Attrition Analysis â€“ Identified trends in workforce retention and key factors influencing attrition.
ðŸš€ Department-Wise Insights â€“ Analyzed the distribution of employees across various departments, helping organizations optimize their workforce structure.
ðŸš€ Salary & Compensation Trends â€“ Explored salary patterns to ensure fair and competitive compensation strategies.
ðŸš€ Hiring & Turnover Trends â€“ Visualized recruitment patterns and employee exits to improve HR planning.
ðŸš€ Diversity & Inclusion Metrics â€“ Provided insights into workforce diversity to promote a more inclusive work environment.

This dashboard empowers HR teams with data-driven decision-making, helping organizations improve employee engagement and optimize workforce management. Excited to continue exploring HR analytics! ðŸš€ðŸ‘¥
